        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Learn about Android Development.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Developing for Android</h3>
        <p>When Android development first became popular, developers had to use a collection of command-line tools to do Android development. One tool would let them configure an Android device for testing; another would compile their code; another would create the app package for testing, etc...</p>
        <p>Over time, people wanted a real Android IDE, so Google teamed up with the people behind IntelliJ to create one. There are now two options. First, you can use the stand-alone Android Studio IDE, which is based on IntelliJ, but with some specific plugins added for Android Development. Second, you can continue to use IntelliJ with the Android development plugins turned on.</p>
        <p>Since they are essentially the same software, there's no real difference between what you can accomplish. However, most tutorials and guides you will find online will assume you're using Android Studio, so that's what we'll use.</p>
        <p>You are welcome to use IntelliJ, but if you do, you'll be mostly on your own.</p>

        
        <h3>Preparation Assignment</h3>

        <p>We've discussed before how the Java libraries and methods of doing things have evolved over the years. For example, the options available to you for reading from a file in Java 8 are much different than those that were available in Java 2.</p>
        <p>This "progressive evolution" is even more remarkable in Android, because new versions of the framework come out almost every year. As with Java, there is a difference between the version number used for marketing, and the one used by internal frameworks (called the API Level). You'll need to be familiar with both.</p>

        <h4>Before Class, complete the following:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">this table</a> showing how the version numbers and API Levels match up. (You don't need to memorize it, but keep it handy in case you're wondering when a specific feature was added.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z98hXV9GmzY">this video from Google</a>, which provides an overview of Android Development and Android Studio.</p>
                <p>Note that the video might show you some information for an older version of Android Studio. As with all aspects of software development, you have to adapt bits and pieces of information to your current needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Follow the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html">instructions in this guide</a> to install Android Studio.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/workflow.html">this overview of the Android development process.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read this introduction regarding <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities">Android activities.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html">this diagram of the Activity lifecycle.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read about how <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/index.html">Android project code is structured.</a></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Reading Quiz</h3>
        <p>Don't forget to take the Reading Quiz in I-Learn. This quiz can be taken as many times as you like, but you must score at least 90% to pass. If you fail the quiz, review the relevant parts of the reading and try again.</p>
        <p>As before, one of the quiz questions is a "deep thought" question whose answer won't come directly from the reading.</p>
