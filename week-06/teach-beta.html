        <p class="subtitle">Multi-threaded Programs</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Create an Android app that runs code on a background thread.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Before continuing, you should have completed this week's <a href="./prepare.html">preparation assignment</a>.</p>

        <p>File, network, and database operations can be very resource expensive, so you should not perform these kinds of operations on a main GUI thread. So, for this assignment, you will use multithreaded programming to be able to run these more complex, time consuming tasks on a background thread, without hanging the GUI.</p>

        <p>To minimize the number of variables in this assignment, rather than working with a database or remote server, you will instead just include a call to <code>Thread.sleep()</code> to simulate the computer spending time working on that task. (In a real project, you wouldn't include sleeping, because it's just wasting time. We are using it for simulation purposes.)</p>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>For this assignment you will create a new android application that simultaneously counts to 100 by evens and also by odds.</p>

        <h4>Part I: Starting the background threads</h4>
        <p>Create a thread that counts to 100 by odd numbers. After displaying the number, include a call to <code>Thread.sleep()</code> to sleep for half a second (500 milliseconds).</p>


        

            
        <h4>Part II: Updating the UI</h4>
